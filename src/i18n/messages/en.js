  article1TitleID: 'Waste management in Russia',
  article1TextID:
    'The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation has estimated that around 60 million metric tons of MSW (Municipal solid waste) is generated each year, amounting to more than 400 kg per capita. The volume of MSW in Russia has been steadily increasing in recent years. The volume of waste does not as such constitute the problem; instead, the problem arises from the ability or inability of governments, individuals, and waste disposal firms to keep up with the task of managing waste and protecting the environment. There is no doubt that a dirty environment affects the standard of living, aesthetic sensibilities, and health of people, and thus has an impact on the quality of their lives. As a consequence, improper disposal or storage of waste can cause hazards to society through the pollution of air, land, and, especially, water. <br> Over 25 million tons of waste is produced each year in Moscow. This includes bulk waste, residential solid waste, industrial and construction site waste as well as waste from water treatment facilities. A large proportion of this is stored and disposed of at waste processing facilities. However, the facilities are nearly packed to capacity. It is thus important for Moscow and the surrounding region to take concerted action to solve the waste management problem. This is a notably complex issue concerning more than 20 different industries. The whole chain of waste management includes the collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage, sewage, and other waste products. ',
  article2TitleID: '5 Opportunities of a Circular Economy ',
  article2TextID:
    'More than 100 billion tons of resources enter the economy every year – everything from metals, minerals and fossil fuels to organic materials from plants and animals. Just 8.6% gets recycled and used again. Use of resources has tripled since 1970 and could double again by 2050 if business continues as usual. We would need 1.5 Earths to sustainably support our current resource use. This rampant consumption has devastating effects for humans, wildlife and the planet. It is more urgent than ever to shift from linear, use-it-up-and-throw-it-away models to a circular economy: where waste and pollution are designed out, products and materials are kept in use for longer, and natural systems can regenerate. <br><br><h5>1) Make better use of finite resources. </h5><br>The circular economy concept is all about making better use of natural resources like forests, soil, water, air, metals and minerals.Take the textiles industry. Each year, huge quantities of fossil fuels are used to produce clothes from synthetic fibers each year. Textile production (including cotton farming) uses almost 100 billion cubic meters of water per year, approximately 4% of global freshwater withdrawal. At the same time, people throw away still-wearable clothes worth an estimated $460 billion each year. Creating a circular economy for textiles means shifting to recycled and recyclable materials in order to reduce the amount of land, water and fossil fuels used to produce new clothes. It means changing consumption patterns to reduce new purchases and keep clothes in use for longer, for instance by developing the second-hand and rental markets as well as changing the culture of fast fashion. Research suggests that the purchase of 100 second-hand garments can displace the production of 85 new garments. And finally, it means ensuring that clothes at the end of their life are collected and recycled or repurposed into new clothes, further reducing resource use.<br><br><h5>2) Reduce emissions.</h5><br>About 45% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from product use and manufacturing, as well as food production. Circular economy strategies that reduce our use of resources can cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 39% (22.8 billion tons) and play a crucial role in averting the dangerous impacts of climate change. For example, shifting towards recycled materials would alleviate the need to produce virgin plastics and synthetic fibers, which would significantly reduce fossil fuel use and associated emissions. Changing consumption patterns is also crucial: For example, if the average number of times a garment is worn were doubled, greenhouse gas emissions from the textiles industry would be 44% lower. Creating a circular economy for food by reducing loss and waste is particularly crucial to lowering emissions: If food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter after the United States and China. <br><br><h5>3) Protect human health and biodiversity. </h5><br>Every year, more than 9 million deaths occur due to air, water and soil pollution. This pollution also threatens biodiversity. Working towards a circular economy helps protect human health and biodiversity in many ways, including by making better use of natural resources (e.g. protecting water and land), and by mitigating the climate crisis. One of the clearest and most direct impacts of the shift to a circular economy will come from how we deal with products at the end of their life. The world produces around 300 million tons of plastic waste every year, nearly equivalent to the weight of the entire human population. This is on top of 54 million tons of electronic waste (e-waste), of which just 17.4% gets collected and recycled. This waste becomes hazardous for human health and for biodiversity when it is mismanaged, either leaking into the natural environment or disposed of through open burning, landfills or substandard recycling. Designing products to be kept in use for longer reduces the amount of waste produced. Creating proper collection and processing systems protects workers and the environment from hazardous materials. For instance, utilizing existing solutions like replacing plastic other materials, designing plastics so that they can be more easily recycled, and scaling up collection and recycling could reduce the flow of plastic waste into the ocean by 80% in 20 years – a shift that would be enormously beneficial for human health and biodiversity. <br><br><h5>4) Boost economies.</h5><br>Research shows that the circular economy offers a $4.5 trillion economic opportunity by reducing waste, stimulating innovation and creating employment. New business models focused on reuse, repair, remanufacturing and sharing models offer significant innovation opportunities. For example, a circular economy for plastics offers considerable economic benefits. Less plastic waste in the ocean would benefit industries like fishing and tourism, as plastic pollution currently leads to $13 billion in costs and economic losses per year. Reducing the pollution and toxic emissions that come from the open burning of plastic waste would lower healthcare costs, while reducing fossil fuel use for plastic production would help mitigate climate change and its associated costs. Many of these economic benefits and opportunities are long-term, indirect and require significant investment; a long-term view is key, as are short-term incentives to drive the change. This can include policies that create more immediate financial incentives for businesses to develop innovative new business models and enable the efficient flow of reused and recycled materials across global value chains.<br><br><h5>5) Create more and better jobs. </h5><br>Transitioning to a circular economy could create a net increase of 6 million jobs by 2030. Making the most of this opportunity will require a clear focus on social and environmental justice. Jobs may be lost in more linear businesses; however new jobs will be created in fields such as recycling, services like repair and rental, or in new enterprises that spring up to make innovative use of secondary materials. These new jobs cannot be considered direct replacements, as they may be in different locations and require different skills. For instance, we must consider the millions of garment workers — mostly women — whose employment depends on the continuation of the fast fashion industry. Investing in a just transition via social dialogue, social protection and reskilling programs is key. While a net increase in jobs is important, another value-add of circularity is the opportunity to provide formal work and improved working conditions for informal laborers. Around 15 million people worldwide work as “waste pickers,” salvaging reusable or recyclable materials from garbage. Bringing these informal waste pickers into formal work in collection or recycling is a major opportunity to offer safer, more secure employment.',

    '<p>Recycling is a lifestyle change that requires discipline and repetition. Here is a tried and true 5-step process that will make this easier. </p><h4>1. Start out small</h4><p>Breaking old habits can be really difficult. Try to start out small by understanding what can and cannot be recycled.</p><br><p>Recyclable</p><ul><li>Aluminum cans</li><li>Corrugated cardboard</li><li>Junk mail</li><li>Glass bottles</li></ul><br><p>Not Recyclable</p><ul><li>Plastic shopping bags</li><li>Foam cups or containers</li><li>Soiled food items</li><li>Broken glass</li></ul><br><h4>2. Purchase separate bins for recyclables at home </h4><p>Now that you know what you can recycle, you can start sorting your household waste into trash and recyclables. Make it easy on yourself and put a few recycling bins around the house. It may take a couple of tries to remind yourself to not throw your used aluminum cans in the trash, but that will change over time as you start to develop the habit. </p><br><h4>3. Find a public drop-off location</h4><p>If you don’t have curbside service, try to find a public drop-off area. Most major cities have locations throughout the area that accept recyclables free of charge. Another option is to see if your workplace has recycling services, and if they allow employees to dispose of their recyclables there.</p><br><h4>4. Subscribe to curbside pickup</h4><p>Once recycling has become second-nature, and you feel comfortable paying a little extra, subscribe to curbside pickup service. Most private waste management companies have this as an option, and it normally only costs about $6 extra a month. To put that into perspective, a cup of coffee and a breakfast sandwich at Starbuck’s can run you almost $10.</p><br><h4>5. Tell people how easy it is and to join the movement </h4><p>Now that you’ve developed the habit of recycling, tell your friends and family how easy it was, educate them on how they can do it too, and get them to commit to recycling. </p>',
